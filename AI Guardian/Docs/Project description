Roadmap (spans multiple cohorts):

Long-term goal (spans multiple cohorts):
* Guardian AI’s long-term goal is to create a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system through Machine Learning (ML) for non-hospital usage. 
* Depending on future circumstances and new findings, future members may want to expand on the HAR system to incorporate more ambitious goals to align with the app’s features as per Guardian’s Executive Summary Document.

- DATA FAMILIARIZATION

Objective: Gain profound insight into Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), fostering a comprehensive understanding of its nature, context, and domain. Research CSI signals to comprehend the methodology behind data collection and understand the meaning and context embedded in the numerical values.

Tasks:
* Research literature on Wi-Fi CSI to understand its basic principles, applications, and relevant methodologies.
* Review documentation related to the collection process of the CSI signals including the hardware specifications, parameters and environmental conditions (refer to the paper from the author).
* Understand fundamentals of CSI signals, including signal amplitude, phase, and frequency.
* Understand the structure of the dataset, including variables and data types.
* Investigate the specifics of the experiments conducted to gather Wi-Fi CSI signals including the activities performed and the duration of recording sessions.
* Examine the numerical values embedded in the CSI signals to understand their meaning and importance.
* Document findings below, such that future cohorts could continue the work with minimal loss.


WI-FI CHANNEL STATE INFORMATION (CSI)
CSI provides detailed information about the wireless channel between a transmitter and a receiver. This information includes data about how radio waves propagate through the environment.

Amplitude: it represents how much the received signal's strength has been altered by the wireless channel. A higher magnitude indicates a stronger received signal, while a lower magnitude suggests a weaker signal.
Phase: it represents how much the received signal's timing has been shifted by the wireless channel compared to the transmitted signal. Changes in phase can occur due to factors like signal reflections and multipath interference.
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is a method of data transmission where a single information stream is split among several closely spaced narrowband subchannel frequencies instead of a single Wideband channel frequency. Wi-Fi networks often use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for data transmission. In OFDM, the data stream is divided into multiple subcarriers. Subcarriers are frequency components within the channel bandwidth used in OFDM-based communication systems like Wi-Fi. They enable efficient data transmission, adaptive modulation and coding, and resource allocation, all while maintaining orthogonality to prevent interference between subcarriers.
How can we detect human activity in Wi-Fi signals? When a person moves within the Wi-Fi signal's path, their body may partially or completely block the signal. The human body can absorb and attenuate radiofrequency signals, causing a reduction in signal strength.

HAR has been getting popular over the last decade due to its use in diverse industries including healthcare. Regarding extraction of features in the recognition of various human activities, WiFi CSI data has recently grown in popularity. Unlike, camaras and phones, Wi-Fi CSI data offers privacy preservation and non-invasive technology. 

Dataset: “background”, “walk”, “sit”, “stand”, “liedown”, “standfromlie”, “bodyrotate”

- DATA PREPROCESSING

Objective: Ensure the data is in a clean, organized, and suitable format for subsequent analysis.  Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, and preparing the data to maximize the effectiveness of ML/DL models.

Tasks:
* Identify and handle missing or incomplete data.
* Check for outliers, noise and anomalies and decide how to address them. Some techniques are mentioned on CSI FOR HAR USING ML-DL.docx
* Standardize or normalize data if necessary.
* Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (such as PCA) to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space.
* Apply Fourier transforms or other complex-number-specific techniques to analyze the frequency components of the signals if necessary.

Research Notes:
* Even in a still environment, CSI values fluctuate as WiFi devices are susceptible to surrounding electromagnetic noises [5]. Internal state changes in WiFi devices (like transmission rate adaptation and transmission power adaptation) can also introduce impulse and burst noises [5].
* Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) is the dynamically changing difference in carrier frequencies between a pair of WiFi devices, which occurs due to the minor differences in hardware and factors such as temperature change [5]. This affects phase values such that it is hard to distinguish whether a phase change is due to environmental change or CFO [5].
* Overall, due to the errors such as CFO, as well as Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO), the phase of WiFi CSI is rarely used for HAR [4]. Therefore, we will condense the complex number to the amplitude only.

Amplitude is noisy and may not show distinctive features for different activities. Therefore, it is necessary to filter out the noise before feature extraction. Existing literature discussed several de-noising methods, which are listed below. Note that many literatures used multiple techniques in unison.

* Low-pass filters (Butterworth filter or Elliptic filter)
o Due to there being burst and impulse noises in CSI, which have high bandwidths, the low-pass filter cannot yield a smooth CSI stream [4]. 
o Low-pass filters or median filters struggles when there are “bursts” of noise

* The sampling rate that these methods require are more than WiFi frequency
* Wavelet-based noise-removal 
o Figure below shows raw amplitude (top) having undergone wavelet-based noise-removal (bottom)

* PCA
o When PCA is applied on temporal CSI (subcarrier data), the first three components are observed to explain 70–80% of the variance for all the activities [6].
* Wang et. al [5] employed the next five PCs for feature extraction, after discarding the first. They also discovered that by removing PC1, the information due to the dynamic reflection coming from the mobile target is retained in other principal components [4]. 
* Damodaran et al. [6] used only the second and the third PCs. This is the technique that we will be proceeding with considering that 2D


- MODEL SELECTION

Objective: Selecting the optimal ML/DL model for the classification of HAR based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and the distinctive characteristics of different models.

Tasks:
* Conduct an extensive review of existing literature on ML/DL models applied to HAR (already done).
* Summarize key findings regarding the performance and suitability of various models for HAR tasks (already done).
* Look for hyperparameter configurations, including learning rates, dropout rates, and layer architectures (the literature review can help us guidance, almost all articles detail the architectures and parameters).
* Consider data splitting: 80-10-10, 70-30 or 80-20.
* Implement cross-validation techniques on the training set if necessary.

2. Related work using the same type of data (Wi-fi CSI signals) and another approach: some researchers have converted CSI data into images-like format and calculate their spectrogram, scalograms or RGB-based image for image classification.
Reason: “CSI data gathered from a single pair of antennas (Transmitter-receiver) are similar to a grayscale image with only one channel. Thus, the number of pairs of antennas is directly proportional to the resolution of the CSI data.”
